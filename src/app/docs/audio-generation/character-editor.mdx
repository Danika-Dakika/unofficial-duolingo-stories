title: "Character Editor"
description: "Assign voices to characters."

In the character editor you can assign voices to the characters that appear in the stories.
You can also assign a name to the character. The name is just for reference if the character is addressed in a story
to always use the same spelling.

The characters in the first row are the basic Duolingo cast. We want to keep their names
as close to the original as possible. Just adjust them to the spelling of the target language.
