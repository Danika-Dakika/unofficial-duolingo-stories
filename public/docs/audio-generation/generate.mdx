Then, for every line, click the spinner next to it.

<Info>It is recommend waiting for each line to generate before moving to the next one,

If you generate them too quickly, the audio line may end up getting misplaced, like this. To fix it, just cut the
hint line, and paste it above the yellow one.

### The audio line
The line that is inserted after the audio has been created show the location of the audio file and the numbers for the
word timings. You generally do not need to edit it.
