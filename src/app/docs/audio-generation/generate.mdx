In the story, click the Audio button in the header.


Then, for every line, click the spinner next to it.

<Info>It is recommend waiting for each line to generate before moving to the next one,
there's currently a small timing issue in it.</Info>

If you generate them too quickly, the audio line may end up getting misplaced, like this. To fix it, just cut the
hint line, and paste it above the yellow one.
