Click the import button in the menu for your language, and click the story you'd like to add. You'll be redirected to the editor for that story.

### Translating the Story

We import stories from Spanish, as they're the most extensive. To translate, swap the Spanish for the language you're translating to, and rearrange the English words to match up with your language's word order.

If you need to change the English words to better fit your language, go ahead.

### Translation Hints
Best practise is to make sure every word/phrasal verb etc. has a hint, but these can occasionally be left out.

To add one hint for multiple words, use the ~ tilde character to link the words together.

The opposite of the tilde character is a pipeline |, which you can use to split a word in two while it appears as one word.
